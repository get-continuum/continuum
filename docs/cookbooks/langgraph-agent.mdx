title: "LangGraph Agent with Continuum"
description: "Drop-in resolve → enforce → commit nodes for LangGraph"
---

## Goal

Prove the Continuum integration pattern inside a stateful LangGraph:

- **pre-plan**: `resolve_node`
- **pre-tool**: `enforce_node`
- **post-run**: `commit_node`

## Install

```bash
pip install continuum-sdk continuum-langgraph langgraph
```

## Run the example

From the repo root:

```bash
python oss/integrations/langgraph/examples/working_example.py
```

## What to look for

- `resolution`: whether the prompt is already covered by a prior decision
- `enforcement_result`: whether the proposed action is allowed/confirm/block
- `committed_decision`: a newly persisted decision (optionally activated)
