# Mining

Mining is the process of extracting **facts** and **decision candidates** from unstructured conversations. Instead of requiring humans to manually identify and commit decisions, the mining pipeline does the heavy lifting.

## How it works

```
Conversation → Extract Facts → Map to Candidates → De-duplicate → Review / Auto-commit
```

### 1. Fact Extraction

The miner scans conversation text for patterns that indicate:

| Category | Example Pattern | Confidence |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| **Preference** | "I prefer trains over flights" | 85% |
| **Constraint** | "Budget is $3000 max" | 90% |
| **Rejection** | "Don't use Redux" | 90% |
| **Interpretation** | "By revenue we mean net_revenue" | 85% |
| **Behavior Rule** | "Always book with free cancellation" | 80% |

Each fact carries an **evidence span** pointing back to the exact quote in the conversation.

### 2. Decision Candidates

Facts are mapped to decision candidates with:
- **Pre-filled decision contract** (title, scope, type, rationale)
- **Risk level** (low, medium, high)
- **Confidence score** (0.0 - 1.0)
- **Evidence chain** (traceable to source)

### 3. Auto-commit Policy

Low-risk candidates with high confidence can be auto-committed:
- Risk = `low` AND confidence >= 0.9
- Decision type is `behavior_rule` or `preference`

All other candidates require human review.

## API

```bash
POST /mine
```

```json
{
  "conversations": ["User: I prefer vegetarian food. Budget max $200..."],
  "scope_default": "user:alice"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "facts": [...],
  "decision_candidates": [...],
  "auto_committed": [...]
}
```

## SDK

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from continuum.client import ContinuumClient

# Via the HTTP API
import requests
result = requests.post("http://localhost:8787/mine", json={
    "conversations": [convo_text],
    "scope_default": "user:alice",
}).json()
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { ContinuumClient } from "@get-continuum/sdk";

const client = new ContinuumClient();
const result = await client.mine({
  conversations: [convoText],
  scope_default: "user:alice",
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## MCP Tool

```
continuum_mine(conversations=["..."], scope_default="repo:myapp")
```

## CLI

```bash
continuum mine --file convo.json --scope user:alice
```

## UI

The Playground has a **Mine** tab where you can paste conversations and:
1. See extracted facts with evidence highlights
2. Review decision candidates in the inbox
3. Commit individually or batch-commit safe candidates
