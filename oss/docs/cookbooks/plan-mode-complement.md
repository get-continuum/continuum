# Cookbook: Plan Mode Complement

## Overview

This cookbook shows how Continuum complements Cursor's **Plan Mode**. When a developer uses Plan Mode to design an approach, those plan edits can become Continuum decisions — creating a persistent, enforceable record of architectural choices.

Plan Mode is ephemeral: it helps you think through changes before making them. Continuum makes those plans durable: the decisions survive across sessions, agents, and team members.

## Prerequisites

- Continuum SDK installed (`pip install -e oss/sdk/python`)
- Cursor IDE with Plan Mode

---

## How Plan Edits Become Decisions

<!-- TODO: Explain the mapping -->
<!-- - Plan Mode edit: "Use React Query instead of SWR" -->
<!-- - Continuum decision: title, options (React Query vs SWR), rationale, scope -->
<!-- - Show how to commit this as a decision -->

## Workflow

<!-- TODO: Step-by-step workflow -->
<!-- 1. Enter Plan Mode in Cursor -->
<!-- 2. Make architectural decisions in the plan -->
<!-- 3. Commit decisions to Continuum -->
<!-- 4. Future agents enforce those decisions automatically -->

## Example

<!-- TODO: Add concrete example -->
<!-- - Plan Mode session transcript -->
<!-- - Corresponding Continuum decisions -->
<!-- - Agent enforcement in a later session -->
