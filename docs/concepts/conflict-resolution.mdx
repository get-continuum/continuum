# Conflict Resolution

When multiple active decisions apply to the same scope, Continuum uses a **deterministic precedence engine** to select the winner — no ML, no heuristics, no randomness.

## Ranking Factors

The precedence engine evaluates competing decisions using a composite score:

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Explicit precedence** | Highest | The `precedence` field on the decision (integer, higher wins) |
| **Scope specificity** | High | More specific scopes win (`user:alice` > `team:eng` > `org:acme`) |
| **Authority** | Medium | `admin` > `lead` > `member` issuer authority |
| **Recency** | Tie-breaker | More recently created decisions win ties |

## Scope Hierarchy

Scopes have a natural hierarchy rank:

```
user (60) > channel (50) > team (40) > org (30) > folder (25) > repo (20) > workflow (15) > global (10)
```

A `user:alice` decision always beats a `team:eng` decision for the same topic, because user-scope is more specific to the individual.

## Human-Readable Explanations

Every arbitration produces a plain-English explanation:

> Decision "Revenue means net_revenue" (dec_abc123) wins among 2 competing decisions.
> Its scope "user:alice" is more specific than "team:eng" (score 70 vs 50).

## Inspector Integration

The Inspector page shows a **"Competing Decisions Detected"** banner when conflicts exist, with:
- Winner and losers with scores
- Full explanation of why the winner was selected
- Option to **Promote** (create a superseding decision in a higher scope)

## API

The `/inspect` endpoint now returns `conflict_notes` alongside the binding set:

```json
{
  "binding": [...],
  "conflict_notes": [
    {
      "type": "precedence_conflict",
      "winner_id": "dec_abc123",
      "loser_ids": ["dec_def456"],
      "explanation": "Decision X wins because...",
      "scores": { "dec_abc123": 70.0, "dec_def456": 50.0 }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Design Principle

Enforcement remains **deterministic**. Given the same set of decisions and the same scope, the same winner is always selected. This is what makes Continuum trustworthy for production use.
