# No-History Split-Run Demo

This is the flagship demo that proves Continuum's differentiation: **decisions persist and enforce correctly even without conversation history**.

## The Setup

The Playground has two toggles:
- **Conversation History**: ON/OFF
- **Continuum Decisions**: ON/OFF

## Demo Script 1: Travel Persistence

### Session 1 — Mine and Commit

1. Paste this conversation:
```
User: I'm planning a trip to Japan next month.
User: Budget is $3000 max.
User: I'm vegetarian and prefer trains over flights. No flying please.
User: Always book hotels with free cancellation.
```

2. Click **Mine** tab → **Extract Facts & Candidates**
3. Review the extracted facts (budget constraint, dietary preference, no-fly rule)
4. Click **Commit all safe** or commit individually
5. Check Inspector — decisions are now active

### Session 2 — No History, Decisions ON

1. Turn OFF "Conversation History"
2. Keep "Continuum Decisions" ON
3. Type: "Plan dinner in Tokyo"
4. Click **Resolve** → The system respects the vegetarian constraint
5. Type: "Book transportation from Tokyo to Kyoto"
6. Click **Resolve** → The system suggests trains (no flights)

### Baseline — No History, No Decisions

1. Turn OFF both toggles
2. Same queries produce generic, unconstrained responses
3. No memory of preferences or constraints

## Demo Script 2: YAML Semantic Ambiguity

### Setup

Two semantic models exist in the repo:
- `examples/semantic-models/marketing.yaml` — Revenue = gross revenue
- `examples/semantic-models/finance.yaml` — Revenue = net revenue

### The Flow

1. Ask: "revenue by country last week"
2. Continuum detects ambiguity (two definitions of "revenue")
3. Clarification card appears with both options
4. Select "Net revenue (finance)" → commits as team decision
5. Switch to Cursor (via MCP) → same query → resolves immediately to finance definition
6. Switch to Slack → same query → no clarification needed

## Why This Matters

This demo is impossible to replicate with:
- **ChatGPT**: No persistence across sessions without plugins
- **Mem0**: Stores memories but doesn't enforce deterministically
- **Custom prompts**: Drift over time, no audit trail

Continuum's decisions are **signed, scoped, versioned, and deterministic** — they survive across surfaces and sessions without any conversation history.
