## What is a Decision?

A **Decision** is the atomic unit of institutional knowledge in Continuum. It records:

- **What** was decided (title)
- **Why** it was decided (rationale)
- **What alternatives** were considered (options)
- **What was rejected** and why (rejected options with reasons)
- **Where** it applies (scope)
- **How** it should be enforced (override policy)

Decisions are immutable once committed to `active` status and are identified by a unique ID.

## Contracts

**Contracts** are JSON Schemas that define the shape of a valid Decision. They ensure every decision carries the required fields and can be validated deterministically.

The current schema version is **0.1.0** (draft), using [JSON Schema Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema).

## Decision Fields

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Unique identifier. Pattern: `dec_[a-zA-Z0-9]+` |
| `version` | `integer` | Version number, starting at 0 |
| `status` | `string` | Lifecycle status: `draft`, `active`, `superseded`, `archived` |
| `title` | `string` | Human-readable title |
| `created_at` | `string` (date-time) | ISO 8601 creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | `string` (date-time) | ISO 8601 last-updated timestamp |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `rationale` | `string` | Why this decision was made |
| `stakeholders` | `array[string]` | People or teams involved |
| `metadata` | `object` | Arbitrary key-value metadata |

### Options Considered

The `options_considered` array records every option that was evaluated:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | `string` | Yes | Unique option identifier (`opt_*`) |
| `title` | `string` | Yes | Description of the option |
| `selected` | `boolean` | Yes | Whether this option was chosen |
| `rejected_reason` | `string` | No | Why this option was rejected |

### Context

The `context` object captures what triggered the decision:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `trigger` | `string` | Yes | What triggered this decision |
| `source` | `string` | Yes | Where the decision originated |
| `timestamp` | `string` | Yes | When the triggering event occurred |
| `actor` | `string` | No | Who or what triggered the decision |

## Decision Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `interpretation` | Defines how an ambiguous term should be understood | "Revenue means net revenue excluding refunds" |
| `rejection` | Explicitly rejects an option, tool, or approach | "Do not use MongoDB for this project" |
| `preference` | Preferred choice among valid alternatives | "Prefer PostgreSQL over MySQL for new services" |
| `behavior_rule` | Behavioral constraint for agents/workflows | "Always run linting before committing" |

## Lifecycle

Decisions follow a strict lifecycle with four states:

```
┌───────┐     ┌────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│ draft │────▶│ active │────▶│ superseded  │────▶│ archived │
└───────┘     └────────┘     └─────────────┘     └──────────┘
                  │                                     ▲
                  └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| From | To | Description |
|------|----|-------------|
| `draft` | `active` | Decision is approved and takes effect |
| `active` | `superseded` | A new decision replaces this one |
| `active` | `archived` | Decision is retired without replacement |
| `superseded` | `archived` | Superseded decision is cleaned up |

<Warning>
Invalid transitions are rejected. You cannot un-activate a decision (`active` → `draft`), re-activate a superseded one, or transition out of `archived`.
</Warning>

## Immutability

Once a decision transitions to `active`, these **core fields become immutable**:

- `id`, `title`, `options_considered`, `context`, `decision_type`, `scope`

Fields that may still be updated: `status` (forward transitions only), `updated_at`, `metadata`, `version`.

## Override Policy

Controls what happens when a rejected option is encountered:

| Policy | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `invalid_by_default` | Rejected option is blocked. **(Default)** |
| `warn` | Allowed but generates a warning |
| `allow` | Informational only — no restriction |

## Example Decision

```json
{
  "id": "dec_abc123",
  "version": 0,
  "status": "active",
  "title": "Use PostgreSQL for user store",
  "decision_type": "rejection",
  "scope": "repo:acme/backend",
  "rationale": "Need ACID transactions for billing data.",
  "options_considered": [
    { "id": "opt_pg", "title": "PostgreSQL", "selected": true },
    { "id": "opt_mongo", "title": "MongoDB", "selected": false, "rejected_reason": "No ACID" }
  ],
  "override_policy": "invalid_by_default",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
}
```
