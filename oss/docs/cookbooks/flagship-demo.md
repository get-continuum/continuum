# Cookbook: Same Prompt, Different Behavior

## Overview

This cookbook demonstrates Continuum's core value proposition: **the same prompt produces different agent behavior depending on prior decisions**.

Without Continuum, every prompt is stateless. With Continuum, the agent checks for prior decisions, enforces consistency, and only asks for clarification when genuinely needed.

## Prerequisites

- Continuum SDK installed (`pip install -e oss/sdk/python`)
- (Optional) Continuum Engine for LLM-backed resolution

---

## Setup

<!-- TODO: Add setup instructions -->
<!-- - Install dependencies -->
<!-- - Seed example decisions -->

## Scenario

<!-- TODO: Define the demo scenario -->
<!-- - Two prompts with the same text but different decision contexts -->
<!-- - Show how one resolves immediately and the other triggers clarification -->

## Running the Demo

<!-- TODO: Add step-by-step instructions -->
<!-- - python demo.py -->
<!-- - Walk through the output -->

## Expected Output

<!-- TODO: Add expected terminal output -->
<!-- - First prompt: "Resolved — using PostgreSQL (decision #abc123)" -->
<!-- - Second prompt: "Needs clarification — no prior decision for this scope" -->

_This cookbook is a placeholder. Full implementation coming in a future milestone._
