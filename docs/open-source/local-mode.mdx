title: Local Mode
description: Run Continuum entirely on your machine — no server needed
---

## Overview

Local Mode stores decisions as JSON files on disk. No server, no database, no network calls. This is the default when you use the SDK without configuring a remote backend.

## How It Works

When you create a `ContinuumClient()` without specifying a storage directory, the SDK uses a local JSON store in `.continuum/`:

```python
from continuum import ContinuumClient

# Local mode — decisions stored in .continuum/ directory
client = ContinuumClient()

# Or specify a custom storage directory
client = ContinuumClient(storage_dir="/path/to/decisions")
```

Decisions are persisted as individual JSON files in a `decisions/` subdirectory.

## Storage Layout

```
.continuum/
  decisions/
    dec_abc123def4.json
    dec_567890abcd.json
```

## Creating Decisions Locally

```python
decision = client.commit(
    title="Use PostgreSQL for user store",
    scope="repo:acme/backend",
    decision_type="rejection",
    options=[
        {"title": "PostgreSQL", "selected": True},
        {"title": "MongoDB", "selected": False, "rejected_reason": "No ACID"},
    ],
    rationale="Need ACID transactions for billing data.",
)

print(f"Stored at: .continuum/decisions/{decision.id}.json")
```

## Retrieving Decisions

Fetch a single decision by ID:

```python
result = client.get(decision.id)
print(result.title)       # "Use PostgreSQL for user store"
print(result.status)      # "draft"
```

List all decisions, optionally filtered by scope:

```python
all_decisions = client.list_decisions()
scoped = client.list_decisions(scope="repo:acme/backend")
```

Get the active "binding set" for a scope:

```python
active = client.inspect("repo:acme/backend")
# Returns list of dicts for all active decisions in that scope
```

Or via the CLI:

```bash
continuum inspect dec_abc123def4
```

## Enforcement in Local Mode

Enforcement is fully deterministic and works identically in local mode:

```python
result = client.enforce(
    action={"type": "generic", "description": "select MongoDB"},
    scope="repo:acme/backend",
)

print(f"Verdict: {result['verdict']}")  # allow | confirm | block
print(f"Reason: {result['reason']}")
```

Or use the `EnforcementEngine` directly for more control:

```python
from continuum.enforce import EnforcementEngine, Action, ActionType

decisions = client.list_decisions(scope="repo:acme/backend")
engine = EnforcementEngine(decisions)

action = Action(
    type=ActionType.generic,
    description="select MongoDB",
    scope="repo:acme/backend",
)
result = engine.evaluate(action)
```

## Migrating to a Remote Backend

When you're ready to share decisions across a team, the SDK can be extended to support remote storage. Local decisions can be exported (as JSON files) and imported into a shared backend.
