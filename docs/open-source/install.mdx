description: Install the Continuum SDK and CLI
---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- pip

## Install the SDK (OSS)

```bash
pip install continuum-sdk
```

This gives you the full deterministic layer: models, schema validation, lifecycle state machine, enforcement engine, and resolve flow.

## Install the CLI

```bash
pip install continuum-cli
```

The CLI provides an inspector interface for managing decisions from the terminal:

```bash
continuum inspect <decision-id>
continuum commit --title "Use PostgreSQL" --scope "repo:acme/backend"
continuum supersede <old-id> --new <new-id>
```

## Install the Core Engine (optional)

If you have a Core license, install the engine for LLM-backed resolution, ambiguity scoring, and advanced policies:

```bash
pip install continuum-sdk
pip install -e core/
```

The SDK auto-discovers engine hooks when Core is installed — no configuration changes needed.

## Verify Installation

```python
from continuum import ContinuumClient

client = ContinuumClient()
print("Continuum is ready!")
```

## Install the MCP Server (optional)

To expose Continuum as MCP tools for agent frameworks:

```bash
pip install continuum-mcp-server
```

This starts a server with tools for `inspect`, `resolve`, `enforce`, and `commit`.
